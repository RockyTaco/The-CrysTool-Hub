## Welcome to The CrysTool Hub

This project was developed with experience from and for University of Tennesee's Professor David Mandrus's Emergent Crystalline Matter Research Group.

It currently has two tools:
- Furnace Graph Generator: This tool helps you design furnace plans by plotting temperature versus time, which can be exported as PDFs. Input temperatures and durations to create points on the graph. Click on a point to remove it.
- Calculate the composition of a compound by entering element symbols, atomic ratios, and total mass. The tool provides weight percentages and partial masses, and you can export the results to Excel.

The website is deployed through vercel, accessible with this link: https://the-crys-tool-hub.vercel.app


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
